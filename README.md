# Disaster Response and Recovery Planning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project analyzes **pre- and post-disaster LiDAR data** to assess structural damage and assist in disaster recovery planning. It uses **machine learning, point cloud processing, and 3D visualization** techniques to detect changes in buildings and terrain.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **LiDAR Data Processing**: Handles raw point cloud data for analysis.  
- **Iterative Closest Point (ICP)**: Aligns pre- and post-disaster scans for comparison.  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - **RandomForestClassifier**: Classifies buildings as **damaged or undamaged**.  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Helps in identifying damage patterns with high accuracy.  
  - **XGBoost**: Optimized gradient boosting for better disaster prediction.  
- **SciPy & Open3D**: Efficient nearest neighbor search and **3D visualization**.  
- **Automated Disaster Assessment**: Identifies **high-risk areas** for recovery efforts.
